  <a>anchor but no link</a><br>
  <a href="https://www.google.com">link</a><br>
  <a href="http://www.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new tab</a>
  <p>
    The noopener value prevents the opened link from gaining access to the webpage from which it 
    was opened. The noreferrer value prevents the opened link from knowing which webpage or resource 
    has a link (or ‘reference’) to it. It also includes the noopener behaviour and thus can be used 
    by itself as well.<br><br>

    Why do we need this added behaviour for opening links in new tabs? Security reasons. The 
    prevention of access that is caused by noopener prevents phishing attacks where the opened 
    link may change the original webpage to a different one to trick users. This is referred to as 
    tabnabbing. Adding the noreferrer value can be done if you wish to not let the opened link know 
    that your webpage links to it.<br><br>

    Note that you may be fine if you forget to add rel="noopener noreferrer" since more recent 
    versions of browsers provide this security if only target="_blank" is present. Nevertheless, in 
    line with good coding practices and to err on the side of caution, it is recommended to always 
    pair a target="_blank" with a rel="noopener noreferrer".
